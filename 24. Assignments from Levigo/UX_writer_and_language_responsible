CEVT (China-Europe Vehicle Technology AB) is the European R&D center for ZEEKR.
ZEEKR is a new electric mobility technology and solutions brand that is aiming to satisfy the global demand
for premium electric vehicles. Our work comes to life in products and services from world leading brands
in the Geely family, such as ZEEKR, Geely Auto, Volvo Cars, Lynk & Co. and Lotus.

Description of the assignment
As a UX writer in the CEVT UX team, you will lead the work of unifying the “voice to the customer” for
ZEEKR products on the European market. You will be responsible for the master English text in our
products (in-vehicle and offboard services), and preferably one or two additional European languages of
your proficiency. We currently handle 11 European languages in our portfolio of products.
You will also take responsibility and lead the process of language handling and translation.
Some of the expected tasks:
• Take responsibility for the development of a clear, concise, and user-friendly English master
language while considering the linguistic nuances of European languages
• Guideline creation for tone of voice and language in cooperation with group-internal stakeholders
and colleagues.
• Take responsibility and further develop our language handling process from text ID mapping, to
ensuring a consistent wording and tone and voice across all platforms and languages. This is
highly dependent on group-internal stakeholders and teams.
• Follow up on legal regulations concerning, e.g., wording for specific functions.
• Lead from product/technical point of view with suppliers
This is a new role in our team, and you are expected to actively take part in forming the role and the
cooperation needed to succeed.

The CEVT User Experience (UX) team is developing interaction design and user experience for ZEEKR’s
infotainment system and other products and services. The team consists of UX designers, UI designers,
prototype developers, and strategists. In the UX team we strive to focus on our team members, providing
prerequisites to develop the best possible experience for our users in a complex environment. We work in
an agile way, yet not fully complying to one specific framework, aiming at continuous learning and
improvement.

We are looking for a motivated UX writer, professionally educated in the field. We expect you to have
proven experience, talent, and capabilities within the competence area we’re searching for. As a person
we think you have a strong sense of teamwork and that you are a kind and helpful team player. Your
creativity and “get things done” attitude goes without saying and you have the ability to motivate, take
responsibility and deliver both on product and process in a global environment.
