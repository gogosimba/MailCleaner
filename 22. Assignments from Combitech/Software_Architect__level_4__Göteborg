It is an Autosar Classic-based platform using Infineon Aurix TriCore processors. Adjacent to HI teams, high-performance (HP) teams exist, and they will be referred to as HPx. The tools JIRA and Confluence are corner stones in planning and knowledge sharing. The ambition is Continuous Integration and an official release every 2nd week. Several High Integrity (HI) teams are jointly responsible for creation and deployment of a platform for high-ASIL components (up to ASIL-D) and safety-critical processes. HI is split into a platform development- and an integration-focused organization. It is developed with the ambition to reuse the platform software across 3 system-on-chips located within the Core System, HI-A, HI-B and HI-C, as well as across the generations of the Core System.

To manage this successfully you need to be working cross-functionally with your team-colleagues and other teams around the company.
